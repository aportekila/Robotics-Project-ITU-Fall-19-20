# Robotics_Course_Project

In this project, we aim to identify the cubes on a table depending on their colors. After that, by taking advantage of 
inverse kinematics, we grasp these cubes, and collect them in hollow cylinder containers. It is like classification 
procedure with respect to the colors of the collision objects.
